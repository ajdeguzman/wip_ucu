                            <p>Urdaneta City University (UCU) started as a rewarding concept of Dr. Pedro T. Orata, world renowed educator and a Ramon Magsaysay awardee to establish an educational complex that will provide basic education all the way through higher education in a single compound, Its humble beginning contrasts its current status as a fast growing and lone local university in the province of Pangasinan. It started maximizing available resources to provide education to knowledge-hungry youth and young adults, believing on the principle of EDUCATION FOR ALL!</p>

                            <p>The College commenced its operation with the provisional permit to open a two-year General Education course granted by the Secretary of Education on Februay 4, 1966. The Secretary further approved the program for Non-formal Education; hence, short-term courses in agriculture and retail business for adults were also offered to assist them in enhancing their earning capabilities. After two years, the first batch of General Education, 84 members, graduated. This paved the way to the opening of a four-year Education program which was granted in 1968.</p>
